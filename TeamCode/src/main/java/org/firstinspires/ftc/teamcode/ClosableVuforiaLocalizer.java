 * This is a VuforiaLocalizer replacement, as it can do everything it does, as well as detach from the camera.
 *     To use, one can replace statements like:
 *
 *         VuforiaLocalizer vuforia = ClassFactory.createVuforiaLocalizer(parameters);
 *
 *     with
 *
 *         ClosableVuforiaLocalizer vuforia = new ClosableVuforiaLocalizer(parameters);
 *
 *     To close vuforia, simply call vuforia.close();
